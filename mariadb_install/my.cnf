# The MariaDB configuration file
#
# The MariaDB/MySQL tools read configuration files in the following order:
# 1. "/etc/mysql/mariadb.cnf" (this file) to set global defaults,
# 2. "/etc/mysql/conf.d/*.cnf" to set global options.
# 3. "/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/*.cnf" to set MariaDB-only options.
# 4. "~/.my.cnf" to set user-specific options.
#
# If the same option is defined multiple times, the last one will apply.
#
# One can use all long options that the program supports.
# Run program with --help to get a list of available options and with
# --print-defaults to see which it would actually understand and use.

#
# This group is read both both by the client and the server
# use it for options that affect everything
#
[client-server]

# Import all .cnf files from configuration directory
!includedir /etc/mysql/conf.d/
!includedir /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/

# This will be passed to all MariaDB clients
[client]
#password=my_password
#port=3306
#socket=/tmp/mysql.sock

# Here is entries for some specific programs
# The following values assume you have at least 32M ram

# The mariadb server  (both [mysqld] and [mariadb] works here)
[mariadb]
#port=3306
#socket=/tmp/mysql.sock

# The following three entries caused mysqld 10.0.1-MariaDB (and possibly other versions) to abort...
# skip-locking
# set-variable  = key_buffer=16M

######### Fix the two following paths

# Where you want to have your database
datadir=/var/lib/mysql

# Where you have your mysql/MariaDB source + sql/share/english
language=/usr/share/mysql/english

########## One can also have a different path for different versions, to simplify development.
